## Academic Bio

I received my B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Mississippi State University, both with distinctions, in 2007 and 2012, respectively. I conducted my dissertation work under the direction of Prof. James E. Fowler on the application of compressed sensing techniques to high-dimensional media, e.g. natural video, multiview image and video, light-field images, and hyperspectral imagery for geosciences. During my Ph.D. studies, I also worked as a research intern for Canon USA, Inc.'s research division in San Jose, CA, where my work lead to a patent for a novel lightfield acquisition system, for which I am listed as a co-inventor. 

After finishing my graduate studies, in 2013 I started a postdoctoral research position at Ecole Normale Supérieure (ENS) in the SPHINX group of Prof. Florent Krzakala. During this fruitful post-doc, I focused my work mainly on the intersection of statistical physics and information problems, specifically, signal processing and machine learning. During my postdoc, I authored a number of works on this subject, including works presented at both ICML and NIPS, and edited a notable book on the same topic.

Following my academic work, I transitioned to industry roles focusing on applied machine learning and AI research. I worked at Gretel.ai where I specialized in synthetic data generation techniques, developing methods to create high-quality synthetic datasets while preserving privacy and statistical properties of original data. Currently, I work as a Principal Research Scientist at NVIDIA, where my focus has expanded to include large language models (LLMs) and their applications in synthetic data generation, as well as advancing the intersection of generative AI and practical machine learning systems.
