title: "Generating Zero-Shot Hard-Case Hallucinations: A Synthetic and Open Data Approach"
pubtype: talk
year: 2025
authors: Eric W. Tramel
in: "Databricks Data + AI Summit (San Francisco, USA)"
abstract: >
    We present a novel framework for designing and inducing controlled hallucinations in long-form content generation by LLMs across diverse domains. The purpose is to create fully-synthetic benchmarks and mine hard cases for iterative refinement of zero-shot hallucination detectors. Using Gretel Data Designer to create long-context datasets, we generate question-answer pairs using chain-of-thought approach, apply consensus labeling to filter synthetic examples, and create an automated system for generating hallucinations. The talk operates under open data licenses like Apache-2.0.
