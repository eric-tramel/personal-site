abstract: >-
    Systems and methods for capturing light field information including spatial and angular information using an image pickup device that includes an image sensor and at least one spatial light modulator (SLM) take multiple captures of a scene using the at least one SLM to obtain coded projections of a light field of the scene, wherein each capture is taken using at least one pattern on the at least one SLM, and recover light field data using a reconstruction process on the obtained coded projections of the light field.
