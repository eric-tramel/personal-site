abstract: >
    A method and apparatus of a device that classifies an image is described. In an exemplary embodiment, the method includes tiling at least one region of interest of the input image into a set of tiles. For each tile, the method includes extracting a feature vector of the tile by applying a convo lutional neural network, wherein a feature is a local descrip tor of the tile; and computing a score of the tile from the extracted feature vector, said tile score being representative of a contribution of the tile into a classification of the input image. The method also includes sorting a set of the tile scores and selecting a subset of the tile scores based on their value and/or their rank in the sorted set. The method also includes applying a classifier to the selected tile scores in order to classify the input image.
