abstract: >
    We present a novel framework for designing and inducing controlled hallucinations in long-form content generation by LLMs across diverse domains. The purpose is to create fully-synthetic benchmarks and mine hard cases for iterative refinement of zero-shot hallucination detectors. Using Gretel Data Designer to create long-context datasets, we generate question-answer pairs using chain-of-thought approach, apply consensus labeling to filter synthetic examples, and create an automated system for generating hallucinations. The talk operates under open data licenses like Apache-2.0.

## Summary

This lightning talk presents a novel framework for designing and inducing controlled hallucinations in long-form content generation by Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse domains. The primary purpose is to create fully-synthetic benchmarks and mine hard cases for iterative refinement of zero-shot hallucination detectors.

## Key Methodology

- **Synthetic Data Generation:** Use Gretel Data Designer to create long-context datasets
- **Question-Answer Generation:** Generate pairs using chain-of-thought approach  
- **Quality Filtering:** Apply consensus labeling to filter synthetic examples
- **Automated Hallucination System:** Create an automated framework for generating controlled hallucinations
