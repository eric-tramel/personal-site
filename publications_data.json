      "abstract": "Compressed-sensing reconstruction of still images and video sequences driven by multihypothesis predictions is considered. Specifically, for still images, multiple predictions drawn for an image block are made from spatially surrounding blocks within an initial non-predicted reconstruction. For video, multihypothesis predictions of the current frame are generated from one or more previously reconstructed reference frames. In each case, the predictions are used to generate a residual in the domain of the compressed-sensing random projections. This residual being typically more compressible than the original signal leads to improved reconstruction quality. To appropriately weight the hypothesis predictions, a Tikhonov regularization to an ill-posed least-squares optimization is proposed.

      "abstract": "A number of techniques for the compressed sensing of imagery are surveyed. Various imaging media are considered, including still images, motion video, as well as multiview image sets and multiview video. A particular emphasis is placed on block-based compressed sensing due to its advantages in terms of both lightweight reconstruction complexity as well as a reduced memory burden for the random-projection measurement operator. For multiple-image scenarios, including video and multiview imagery, motion and disparity compensation is employed to exploit frame-to-frame redundancies due to object motion and parallax, resulting in residual frames which are more compressible and thus more easily reconstructed from compressed-sensing measurements. Extensive experimental comparisons evaluate various prominent reconstruction algorithms for still-image, motion-video, and multiview scenarios in terms of both reconstruction quality as well as computational complexity.",

The resulting nearest-regularized-subspace classifier seeks an approximation of each testing sample via a linear combination of training samples within each class. The class label is then derived according to the class which best approximates the test sample. The distance-weighted Tikhonov regularization is then modified by measuring distance within a locality-preserving lower-dimensional subspace. Furthermore, a competitive process among the classes is proposed to simplify parameter tuning. Classification results for several hyperspectral image data sets demonstrate superior performance of the proposed approach when compared to other, more traditional classification techniques.",

In essence, block-based compressed-sensing sampling is deployed independently within each subband of each decomposition level of a wavelet transform of an image. The corresponding multiscale reconstruction interleaves Landweber steps on the individual blocks with a smoothing filter in the spatial domain of the image as well as thresholding within a sparsity transform. Experimental results reveal that the proposed multiscale reconstruction preserves the fast computation associated with block-based compressed sensing while rivaling the reconstruction quality of a popular total-variation algorithm known for both its high-quality reconstruction as well as its exceedingly large computational cost.",

The current standard of care in nonmetastatic settings is neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), but treatment efficacy varies substantially across patients. This heterogeneity is still poorly understood, partly due to the paucity of curated TNBC data. Here we investigate the use of machine learning (ML) leveraging whole-slide images and clinical information to predict, at diagnosis, the histological response to NACT for early TNBC women patients. To overcome the biases of small-scale studies while respecting data privacy, we conducted a multicentric TNBC study using federated learning, in which patient data remain secured behind hospitals\u2019 firewalls.

This strategy improves robustness to data heterogeneity while also reducing the potential for information leaks by not sharing the center-specific layer activation statistics.

      "abstract": "Analysis of histopathology slides is a critical step for many diagnoses, and in particular in oncology where it defines the gold standard. In the case of digital histopathological analysis, highly trained pathologists must review vast whole-slide-images of extreme digital resolution ( pixels) across multiple zoom levels in order to locate abnormal regions of cells, or in some cases single cells, out of millions. The application of deep learning to this problem is hampered not only by small sample sizes, as typical datasets contain only a few hundred samples, but also by the generation of ground-truth localized annotations for training interpretable classification and segmentation models. We propose a method for disease localization in the context of weakly supervised learning, where only image-level labels are available during training. Even without pixel-level annotations, we are able to demonstrate performance comparable with models trained with strong annotations on the Camelyon-16 lymph node metastases detection challenge. We accomplish this through the use of pre-trained deep convolutional networks, feature embedding, as well as learning via top instances and negative evidence, a multiple instance learning technique from the field of semantic segmentation and object detection.",

We propose a new approach to stabilizing AMP in these contexts by applying AMP updates to individual coefficients rather than in parallel. Our results show that this change to the AMP iteration can provide theoretically expected, but hitherto unobtainable, performance for problems on which the standard AMP iteration diverges. Additionally, we find that the computational costs of this swept coefficient update scheme is not unduly burdensome, allowing it to be applied efficiently to signals of large dimensionality.",

We propose an alternative deterministic iterative procedure based on an improved mean field method from statistical physics known as the Thouless-Anderson-Palmer approach. We demonstrate that our algorithm provides performance equal to, and sometimes superior to, persistent contrastive divergence, while also providing a clear and easy to evaluate objective function.

Such a balance is derived from the inter-client and intra-client uncertainty quantification. A larger inter-client variation implies more personalization is needed. Correspondingly, our method uses uncertainty-driven local training steps an aggregation rule instead of conventional local fine-tuning and sample size-based aggregation. With experimental studies on synthetic data, Amazon Alexa audio data, and public datasets such as MNIST, FEMNIST, CIFAR10, and Sent140, we show that our proposed method can achieve significantly improved personalization performance compared with the existing counterparts.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning frameworks leverage GPUs to perform massively-parallel computations over batches of many training examples efficiently. However, for certain tasks, one may be interested in performing per-example computations, for instance using per-example gradients to evaluate a quantity of interest unique to each example. One notable application comes from the field of differential privacy, where per-example gradients must be norm-bounded in order to limit the impact of each example on the aggregated batch gradient. In this work, we discuss how per-example gradients can be efficiently computed in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We compare existing strategies by performing a few steps of differentially-private training on CNNs of varying sizes. We also introduce a new strategy for per-example gradient calculation, which is shown to be advantageous depending on the model architecture and how the model is trained. This is a first step in making differentially-private training of CNNs practical.",

Digital twins have the potential to revolutionize medicine by enabling individual-level computer simulations of human health, which can be used to conduct more efficient clinical trials or to recommend personalized treatment options. Due to the overwhelming complexity of human biology, machine learning approaches that leverage large datasets of historical patients' longitudinal health records to generate patients' digital twins are more tractable than potential mechanistic models. In this manuscript, we describe a neural network architecture that can learn conditional generative models of clinical trajectories, which we call Digital Twin Generators (DTGs), that can create digital twins of individual patients. We show that the same neural network architecture can be trained to generate accurate digital twins for patients across 13 different indications simply by changing the training set and tuning hyperparameters. By introducing a general purpose architecture, we aim to unlock the ability to scale machine learning approaches to larger datasets and across more indications so that a digital twin could be created for any patient in the world.",

For this third edition, iTWIST'16 gathered about 50 international participants and features 8 invited talks, 12 oral presentations, and 12 posters on the following themes, all related to the theory, application and generalization of the \"sparsity paradigm\": Sparsity-driven data sensing and processing (e.g., optics, computer vision, genomics, biomedical, digital communication, channel estimation, astronomy); Application of sparse models in non-convex/non-linear inverse problems (e.g., phase retrieval, blind deconvolution, self calibration); Approximate probabilistic inference for sparse problems; Sparse machine learning and inference; \"Blind\" inverse problems and dictionary learning; Optimization for sparse modelling; Information theory, geometry and randomness; Sparsity? What's next? (Discrete-valued signals; Union of low-dimensional spaces, Cosparsity, mixed/group norm, model-based, low-complexity models, ...); Matrix/manifold sensing/processing (graph, low-rank approximation, ...); Complexity/accuracy tradeoffs in numerical methods/optimization; Electronic/optical compressive sensors (hardware).",
